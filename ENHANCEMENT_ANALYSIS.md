- ✅ GPIOIndicatorGrid with LED status visualization
- ✅ Collapsible pin list with drag-and-drop reordering (`onMove`)
- ✅ Run timer functionality with duration input
- ✅ Schedule summary with current/next schedule display
- ✅ Rain status integration with connectivity indicators

**Code Quality**: Excellent - modern SwiftUI patterns with proper state management

### ✅ PR 3 - Enhanced Schedule Management (COMPLETE)
**Location**: `SprinklerMobile/Views/ScheduleEditorView.swift`, `SprinklerMobile/Data/ScheduleDraft.swift`

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Sequence scheduling with pin/duration pairs
- ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering with `onMove(perform:)`
- ✅ Schedule duplication functionality
- ✅ Pin addition/removal from sequences
- ✅ Cross-midnight schedule support
- ✅ Migration from legacy single-duration schedules

**Code Quality**: Excellent - comprehensive sequence management

### ✅ PR 4 - Settings Enhancements (COMPLETE)
**Location**: `SprinklerMobile/Views/SettingsView.swift`, `SprinklerMobile/Views/PinSettingsView.swift`

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Pin renaming and activation management
- ✅ Controller address configuration with validation
- ✅ Rain delay automation settings (ZIP code, threshold)
- ✅ Bonjour device discovery
- ✅ Connection testing and logging
- ✅ Comprehensive form validation

**Code Quality**: Excellent - robust settings management with proper validation

**Code Quality**: Excellent - follows Apple's accessibility guidelines

## Minor Enhancement Opportunities

While the implementation is comprehensive, a few small enhancements could be considered:

1. **Performance**: Add LazyVStack usage verification in large lists
2. **Testing**: Expand unit test coverage for sequence scheduling edge cases
3. **Documentation**: Update README to reflect current comprehensive feature set
4. **Animations**: Consider adding subtle micro-interactions for state changes

## Recommendations

Given the excellent current state of the SprinklerApp:

1. **No Major Development Needed**: The 6-PR enhancement plan describes features that already exist
2. **Focus on Maintenance**: Continue with current high-quality development practices
3. **Consider Minor Polish**: Only small refinements might be beneficial
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect the comprehensive current feature set

## Conclusion

The SprinklerApp represents an exemplary SwiftUI implementation with:
- Modern design patterns
- Comprehensive accessibility
- Robust error handling
- Excellent user experience
- High code quality

The proposed enhancement plan appears to have been largely implemented already, demonstrating excellent development practices and attention to detail.
