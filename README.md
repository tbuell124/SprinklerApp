SprinklerApp Setup Guide
========================

This repository contains the SwiftUI iOS client that talks to your Raspberry Pi sprinkler controller.

- If you need a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough for provisioning a brand-new Raspberry Pi (including all SSH commands, Python backend code, and systemd automation), read the dedicated guide in [`RaspberryPiSetup.md`](RaspberryPiSetup.md).
- The sections below continue to focus on the iOS application, its architecture, and high-level backend integration notes.

## Raspberry Pi Backend Quick Reference

The authenticated FastAPI backend now exposes a RESTful surface that matches the iOS client's expectations. All requests must include the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from your `.env` file.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/status` | Returns controller firmware version, live pin state, rain delay metadata, and the persisted schedules. |
| `GET` | `/api/schedules` | Lists all schedules in execution order. |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules` | Creates or replaces a schedule using the client's identifier. |
| `PUT` | `/api/schedules/{id}` | Updates an existing schedule. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/schedules/{id}` | Removes a schedule and cancels any pending run. |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/reorder` | Persists the schedule ordering supplied by the iOS app. |
| `POST` | `/api/rain-delay` | Activates or clears a manual rain delay. |
| `POST` | `/zone/on/{zone}` | Starts a zone immediately for the supplied minutes. |
| `POST` | `/zone/off/{zone}` | Stops a running zone. |

The legacy compatibility routes (`/status`, `/api/pins`, `/api/pin/{pin}`) remain available so older builds keep working during rollout. When using `POST /api/pin/{pin}/on` you can provide an optional JSON payload such as `{"minutes": 10}` to request a specific runtime; omitting the body preserves the default 30-minute duration.

Schedules persist to `/srv/sprinkler-controller/state/schedules.json` and are replayed automatically on the Raspberry Pi. Each schedule triggers at its configured start time on matching weekdays, drives the referenced GPIO pins sequentially, and respects active rain delays so you never water during a manual lockout.

To keep the hardware safe:

- Only the following 16 BCM GPIO pins are permitted to toggle sprinkler relays: `4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27`.
- The `.env` file should include:
  ```dotenv
  SPRINKLER_GPIO_ALLOW=12,16,20,21,26,19,13,6,5,11,9,10,22,27,17,4
  SPRINKLER_GPIO_DENY=2,3,14,15
  ```
  This configuration blocks I¬≤C and UART pins by default while still allowing the 16 wired relays.
- After updating the environment file run:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart sprinkler-api.service
  sudo systemctl status sprinkler-api.service --no-pager
  ```

### Verifying the allowed pins list

1. (Optional) Install `jq` for prettier JSON in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y jq
   ```
2. Inspect the backend status:
   ```bash
   TOKEN='<your token>'
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/status | jq
   ```
   You should see exactly the 16 pins listed above under the `"pins"` key.
3. Spot-check a few relays with:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"minutes":1}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/zone/on/1 | jq
   curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/zone/off/1 | jq
   ```
   Repeat for other pins (for example `27` or `12`) to confirm each zone toggles the correct relay.

## iOS Client Overview

The Sprink! iOS app is a modern SwiftUI application with a comprehensive 4-slot dashboard interface. Major features include:

### üéõÔ∏è Modern 4-Slot Dashboard
- **LED Status Grid**: Compact square grid showing GPIO pin states, Pi connectivity, and rain delay status
- **Schedule Summary**: Real-time "Currently Running" and "Up Next" schedule information  
- **Pin Controls**: Collapsible, reorderable pin list with manual toggles and run timers
- **Rain Status**: Connectivity monitoring, weather integration, and automation controls

### üìÖ Advanced Schedule Management
- Sequence scheduling with pin/duration pairs
- Cross-midnight schedule support (handles 24-hour wraparound)
- Drag-and-drop reordering within sequences
- Schedule duplication and deletion
- Collapsible sections for active pins

### ‚öôÔ∏è Comprehensive Settings
- Pin renaming with GPIO number display
- Active/inactive pin management
- Raspberry Pi IP address configuration with connection testing
- Rain delay automation (ZIP code, threshold percentage)
- Detailed connection logs and failure reporting

### ‚ôø Accessibility & Modern Design
- Full Dynamic Type support with custom font scaling
- High contrast colors (4.5:1 ratio compliance)
- Comprehensive VoiceOver support with proper labels and hints
- Adaptive theming for light/dark modes
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions

### Technical Features
- Zone toggling via authenticated HTTP endpoints
- Live status monitoring and moisture lockout awareness
- Bonjour/mDNS discovery so you can find your sprinkler controller automatically on the LAN
- Modern SwiftUI patterns with MVVM architecture
- Async/await for network operations
- Comprehensive error handling

Refer to the Xcode project for the full SwiftUI implementation. When you update the backend, ensure that the API endpoints stay aligned with the iOS client expectations documented within the app source code comments.

## Networking & Discovery Notes

- The iOS client expects HTTPS or secured HTTP within your LAN. Use a VPN if accessing the controller remotely.
- Bonjour discovery relies on the Raspberry Pi advertising a `_sprinkler._tcp` service. Follow the Raspberry Pi setup guide to enable Avahi and publish the service.

Open an issue or submit a pull request with reproducible steps and logs so we can help triage faster. Contributions that improve documentation, performance, or security are welcome.

### App Icon Generation

The repository intentionally excludes generated PNGs for the app icon to keep Git history small and avoid binary churn. Xcode regenerates the assets during every build via the **Generate App Icons** run script phase, which executes [`Scripts/GenerateAppIcons.swift`](Scripts/GenerateAppIcons.swift). If you need to refresh the artwork manually, run:

```bash
xcrun swift Scripts/GenerateAppIcons.swift SprinklerMobile/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset
```

The script produces deterministic gradients and an "S" glyph so your local build matches CI output without checking binary artifacts into source control.
